                <p> Hey! I am Akshar, currently I am pursuing my masters in Information management and Systems at the Ischool in UC Berkeley. I have a background in Computer science and have previously worked 3 years working with Fidelity Investments as a software engineer, 
                    specifically building their trade processing and settlement platforms focusing on building not only great products but also making 
                    sure that they are performant and resilient to high loads. Currently I am trying to learn as much to build over my knowledge of the field 
                    and tryin to leverage my past experience to build even better products. In my freetime I love sketching ideas on my notebook or out on a run.
